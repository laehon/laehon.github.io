I am currently in my third year at Northwestern University, pursuing a combined BS/MS in Computer Engineering within four years. My main areas of interest are robotics and chip design. My passion for robotics began in high school through the FIRST Tech Challenge, and I have continued to develop this interest at Northwestern by taking courses like Mechatronics and Microprocessor System Design. More recently, I discovered my interest in chip design, which grew from my fascination with logic design. To deepen my knowledge in this field, I have taken courses in Computer Architecture and ASIC & FPGA Design.
